# 📚 Alurabooks

Project built during the course track ["Aprofunde em React e Comunique APIs"](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-react-consumindo-apis). It's a book e-commerce with API calls for authentication and data fetching. The main goal was to learn some React libraries and to discover different ways to handle APIs calls.

## 🖱️ How to use 

The API was not built by me, so it's not hosted for continuos use. You must [clone it](https://github.com/alura-cursos/alurabooks-gql) and run **npm run start:dev** and **npm run start:api** in order to use all features of the website. Make sure the ports in your localhost match the ones used in the API (9000 and 8000).
